# Martin Luther's 95 Theses (as Plato's Cave Allegory)

This website argues that Martin Luther's 95 Theses exist as a historical manifestation of Plato's Cave Allegory. Both the allegory and the theses contain themes of challenging established authority and questioning one's understanding of the world. Martin Luther, who left the "dark cave" of the Roman Catholic Church to publish the 95 Theses, encouraged Christians to leave the Catholic Church in favor of a more direct connection with god and to seek a pursuit of higher knowledge directly from scripture rather than solely relying on the teachings of the Catholic Church.
